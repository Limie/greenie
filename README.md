##The Beginning:

####Upon realizing that the blogosphere was a place I wanted to be

I discovered Blogspot, a Google run tool for bloggers. Ok! Great! I write a blog, you can actually see it  [here](https://github.com/Limie/marty-nerdland/blob/master/articles/notion-wasted-vote-american-traitors-take-new-form.markdown "Title") 
and how it's not on blogspot.  It turns out that in the the short time that my blog was posted it generated almost 20 
hits. Sounds like a good thing, until my highly inqusitive socially conscious side kicks in.

#### I don't know if this is a big deal but it feels like one.

Now you might not think that is a lot probably because it's not. However for me to write something that almost 20 
different people saw in less than one day. It seemed like kind of a big deal, too big a deal to just hand it over 
willingly to Google. I was overwhelmed with the consequences of such to say the least. Here I am using a website that 
I barely can stand hosting my e-mail with and I just want to hand over my well thought out ideas for them to distribute 
as they wish. Something makes me very uncomfortable with that Idea. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that 
Google stock is currently at over $600 a share, and I don't have any of them in my back pocket. or it could be that 
their privacy policies are to say the least extraneous. So why would I want to promote a company that I am not 
personally invested in, or has policies that I can easily, in a reasonable amount of time understand.

So I decided to contact my good olde friend Kingdon to gather an educated opinion on the topic. Kingdon is one of the 
smartest people I know and if anyone can help solve this conundrum of socially conscience blogging well I knew he could 
help and indeed he has.
